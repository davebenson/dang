WARNING CONDITIONS:
_ high trap counts?

TODO:
_ Review dsk-dispatch API... has_idle and has_timeout are clearly bogus...
  implement epoll support.
_ HTTP Client implementation (search for TODO in dsk-http-client.h)
_ HTTP Client Stream
  _ content-encoding gzip
_ XML Parser: UTF-16 support
_ HTTP Server Stream implementation
  _ content-encoding gzip
_ HTTP Server implementation
_ MIME Multipart Impl
_ dsk_buffer_validate() -- assert all fragments are non-zero length
_ XML implementation
  x xml node object
  x parser
  _ parser: suppress whitespace
  _ parser: UTF-16
  _ printer / pretty-printer
_ JSON implementation
  _ parser
  _ printer
_ YAML implementation
  _ parser
  _ printer
_ checksum implementations
_ zlib filters

LATER
_ SSL and HTTPS

DOCUMENTATION
*everything needs docs, but just remind ourselves of subtle stuff*
_ pick a documentation standard

CODING STANDARDS
_ "len" or "length"?  ANSWER: length
_ size_t everywhere ?
_ DskClientStreamSource BUT DskOctetStreamSourceFd.
  Fix this inconsistency and come up with a policy for naming derived classes
