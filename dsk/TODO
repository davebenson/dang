_ remove persistency support from DskClientStream !?!
_ dsk_buffer_transfer, dsk_buffer_drain: consolidate fragments
  if they are both small.
_ figure out a way to tune buffer allocations
  (perhaps a way to build to write a behavior log?)
_ Is the post_data hack of dsk_http_server_stream_respond() really ok?
_ Review dsk-dispatch API... has_idle and has_timeout are clearly bogus...
  implement epoll support.
_ HTTP Header Work:
  _ "no_cache" response:
    HTTP/1.1:
      Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate
      Cache-Control: post-check=0, pre-check=0
    HTTP/1.0:
      Pragma: no-cache

_ HTTP Client implementation (search for TODO in dsk-http-client.h)
_ HTTP Client Stream
  _ content-encoding gzip
_ HTTP Server Stream implementation
  _ content-encoding gzip
_ HTTP Server implementation
_ MIME Multipart Impl
_ XML implementation
  x xml node object

  _ parser: suppress whitespace
  _ parser: UTF-16
  _ parser: other char encodings? iconv plugin?
  _ parser: parsing dtd headers:
    _ internal entities
    _ external entities (a config parameter?)
    _ validation?

LATER
_ SSL and HTTPS

DOCUMENTATION
*everything needs docs, but just remind ourselves of subtle stuff*
_ pick a documentation standard

CODING STANDARDS
_ "len" or "length"?  ANSWER: length
_ size_t everywhere ?
_ DskClientStreamSource BUT DskOctetStreamSourceFd.
  Fix this inconsistency and come up with a policy for naming derived classes
